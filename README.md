# LetterBoxd Watchlist Picker 

This is a little project, that is live at

### https://letterboxdpicker.com

It scrapes your letterboxd watchlist and allows you to pick a random movie from it if you suffer from decision paralysis like me, you also have the ability to filter between the genre and the rating of the movie you'd like.

## Issues

Due to letterboxd API being private, I've had to scrape all the information avialble, this does however cause issues with request times if a large amount of people request simultationously there will be timeouts for around 60 seconds, 
though after the first request you are free to spam as much as you want as your movies will be stored on your client, if you just like spam clicking randomly like me :)
